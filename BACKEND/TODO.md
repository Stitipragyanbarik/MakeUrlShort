# URL Shortener Backend - GitHub Preparation Tasks

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Analyze load test results
- [x] Create comprehensive README.md
- [x] Create Dockerfile for backend
- [x] Create docker-compose.yml for backend with MongoDB and Redis
- [x] Identify unused files and code

## Pending Tasks
- [ ] Remove unused files:
  - load-test-processor.js
  - load-test-processor.cjs
  - test-endpoints.js
  - start_servers.bat
  - ecosystem.config.cjs
  - src/models/userModel.js
- [ ] Create .dockerignore file
- [ ] Test docker build and run
- [ ] Update package.json scripts if needed
- [ ] Final code review for production readiness

## Load Test Summary
- Total requests: 19340
- Success rate: 99.83% for redirect, 100% for create/health/metrics
- Avg response time: 8.98ms (create), 6.71ms (redirect)
- Achieved throughput: 185 req/sec (target was 150)
- Some ECONNREFUSED errors under peak load - server overload

## Production Readiness Assessment
- [x] Connection health checks and timeouts implemented
- [x] Rate limiting and connection limiting tuned for load
- [x] Security middleware (Helmet, CORS, compression)
- [x] Graceful degradation and background persistence
- [x] Minimal logging in production
- [x] Error handling and retry mechanisms
- [x] Docker containerization ready

## Dockerization
- Dockerfile created with Node.js 18 Alpine
- docker-compose.yml with backend, MongoDB, Redis
- Health checks and security hardening included
